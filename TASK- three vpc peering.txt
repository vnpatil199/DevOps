step -1 (mumbai)
go to the vpc service
create vpc 10.0.0.0/16
create 1 private subnet and 1 public subnet (allow public ip to public subnet )
public subnet- 10.0.0.0/20
private subnet- 10.0.16.0/20
then create internet gateway and attach to the vpc
go to the route table select the route table of vpc that you created then edit route table
o.o.o.o intrnet gateway
then go to the route table edit route table
11.0.32.0/20 peering connection
12.0.48.0/20 peering connection

then launch instances using public and private subnet
and allow ALL ICMP -IV4 port both the instances 


step-2 (ohio)
go to the vpc service
create vpc 11.0.0.0/16
create 1 private subnet
private subnet- 11.0.32.0/20
create vpc peering ohio to mumbai
and accept the request from mumbai
then go to the route table edit route table
10.0.16.0/20 peering connection


then launch instance by using private subnet 
and allow ALL ICMP -IV4 port to the instances 


step-3 (origon)
go to the vpc service
create vpc 12.0.0.0/16
create 1 private subnet
private subnet- 12.0.48.0/20
create vpc peering origon to mumbai
accept the request from mumbai
then go to the route table edit route table
10.0.16.0/20 peering connection

then launch instance by using private subnet 
and allow ALL ICMP -IV4 port to the instances
